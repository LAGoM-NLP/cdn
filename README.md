# cdn
Content distribution repo for the LAGoM website, so we can keep the website repo history lightweight.

## Layout
To keep this repo organised, please lay out your files under folders as follows:
- `{content type}/{file extension}/{year}/{person}/`

This way, there is maximal reuse of the folder structure between people and across years.
